### Research

Ongoing project under [Prof. Antonio Torralba](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/vision/torralbalab/) extending the functionality of and benchmarking a [Multimodal Automated Interpretability Agent](https://github.com/multimodal-interpretability/maia) for automated bias detection in vision-language models.

[*Impact of Pocket Geometry on Quantum Dot Lasers Grown on Silicon Wafers*](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/adpr.202300317). R. Koscica, C. Shang, K. Feng, E. T. Hughes, **[C. Li]()**, A. Skipper, J. Bowers. Advanced Photonics Research (2023). 
- Research conducted under [Prof. John Bowers](https://optoelectronics.ece.ucsb.edu/profile/john-bowers) at UC Santa Barbara. Optimized the integration of optical waveguides with quantum dot laser devices on photonic chips using in-house fabrication techniques.

[*Dispersion Engineering and Low-Loss Optimization of Footprint-Efficient and Rotationally Asymmetric Resonators*](https://opg.optica.org/abstract.cfm?uri=CLEO_SI-2023-JW2A.68). **[C. Li]()**, D. Westly, K. Srinivasan, and G. Moille. [Poster](/documents/CLi_CLEO_poster.pdf) at the Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics, San Jose, USA (2023).
- Research conducted under [Dr. Kartik Srinivasan](https://srinivasan.jqi.umd.edu/) at the Joint Quantum Institute. Developed a predictive model for the intuitive design of spatially-optimized whispering gallery resonators for applications in nonlinear optics and quantum optics.

### Software

[MIT Solar Electric Vehicle Team](https://www.mitsolar.com/) --- Developed a Python-based traffic model using the OpenStreetMap API for the team's energy optimization system.

[Booksalotl](https://github.com/christykl/booksalotl) --- MERN stack web application for tracking and rating books and generating and sharing reading statistics. Integrated Google OAuth for secure user authentication, allowing personalized book management and implemented a book search feature utilizing the Google Books API.

[Medify](https://github.com/christykl/Medify) --- Medical chatbot that strengthens communication between seniors and health professionals by translating bare symptoms into coherent descriptions of possible ailments in medical terminology. Created in 24 hours at HackMIT 2023.
